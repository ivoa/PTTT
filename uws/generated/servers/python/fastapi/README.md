## Implementing your service logic

The FastAPI application generated by this project is intended to be a starting point for your service logic.
You can either implement your service logic by:

1. Directly modifying the generated API file in src/uws_server/uws_server.apis/uws_api.py
2. Creating a subclass of the base API BaseUWSApi class in uws_api_base.py and overriding the methods you want to change.

Option 2 is the recommended approach, as it allows you to upgrade the generated code without overwriting your implmentation logic.
For your convenience, an example implementation of the base class is provided in uws_api_impl.py These implementations only provide basic example logic for the service and should be replaced with your own.
